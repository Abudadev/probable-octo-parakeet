        <p>Welcome young Astronomer! Here you will start your journey of
        Astronomy: astronomy is the study of space! In this webpage you will learn all about the universe! You will learn about stars,planets, and even about galaxies! So let's start digging in some knowledge of</p>

        <h2>Planets</h2>

        <p>Let's start off by something giant for us humans.
             But tiny for our humongous universe! Planets! 
             Now what are planets? Oh it's mercury or venus or so on but to be a planet you would need some key properties. 
             Some are</p>

        <ul style="list-style: inside square;">
        <li><i>it needs to be orbiting a star.</i> What orbit means is spin around so to say a planet is a planet one of the properties it needs to have is orbiting a star else it might be something else</li>
        <li><i>it needs to be a sphere or almost a sphere shape.</i> Sphere is a circle but in 3 dimensions or in short 3D</li>
        <li><i>it needs to have enough gravity to pull things toward itself.</i> Gravity is the ability to pull things toward themsleves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Now if that all planets need to be orbiting a star,and need to have a sphere or almost a sphere like shape, and all need to be able to pull things in them. Then what is the differnce between different type of planets?</h2>
        
        <p>Good question!
         These are the required properties to be a planet! 
         Now you can have more than just this! 
         Some planets are very hot like venus and some are very bright and glow like mercury!
          Some have different color patterns like jupiter!
           Some are freezing cold like uranus!
            Some are very stromy like neptune!</p>

                        <p> Fun Fact!: You can see mercury on the western side which is about 1 hour before sunset,and on the eastern side rising 1 hour before the sun!</p>

        <h1>Stars</h1>
        <p>Now what are stars, what makes them different than planets?</p>
        <h3>what makes stars different than planets? Here are somethings that make a star!</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: inside square;">
            <li>
                <i>the star should make it's own light.</i> Meaning it needs make it's own light 
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>the star needs to be made of gas or plasma.</i> To learn more about states of matter go to the basic science webpage then come back here you will understand way better!
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>the star needs to have at least 8.7% of the diameter of the sun.</i> Diameter means a straight line from the center to either end of the object 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Now stars can come in different amounts of glow,different colors,and different sizes but why do we need stars?</h2>
        <p>Great question! One star that maybe every human knows is the sun! Now the sun keeps us warm and nice without it, every solid in the solar system will be a giant piece of ice. We cannot live without the sun it will be too cold to find food,we will easily get forstbitten, and overall our bodies will not be able to survive because it would be too cold! Stars glow without them the night sky will be empty and technology for space will get some big damage in developing because there would be less curiosity, or new discoveries! At least for stars not <b>everything</b>.</p>
        <i><b>Fun Fact! <span class="red">The coldest stars are red!</span> <span id="yellow">The medium hot stars are yellow!</span> <span class="blue"> The hottest stars are Blue!</span></b></i>
